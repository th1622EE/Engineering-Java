## Introduction

This repository is a mirror of my Engineering-Cpp and Engineering-Python repositories. These repositories exist as a reference for specific implementations, and a comparison of each individual language (Java, C++, and Python) for each implementation. The purpose of this is to accentuate the strengths and weaknesses of the individual languages (Java, C++, and Python) relative to specific implementations. C++ is great for time-critical hardware-centric applications, and Python is great for rapid prototyping and complex scientific-based numerical analysis. However, *I am of the opinion that* from the software-centric application perspective, Java is the perfect language for just about everything in between (on the server-side/backend). Lastly, for the purpose of full disclosure, I am **NOT** claiming to be a professional Java developer. I created this repository as a means of further developing/refining my Java development skills, and in doing so have simply chosen to share the code with anyone whom it may benefit.

## Introduction

This repository is a mirror of my Engineering-Cpp and Engineering-Python repositories. These repositories exist as a reference for specific implementations and a comparison of each individual language (Java, C++, and Python) for each implementation. The purpose of this is to accentuate the strengths and weaknesses of the individual languages (Java, C++, and Python) relative to specific implementations. C++ is great for time-critical hardware-centric applications, and Python is great for rapid prototyping and complex scientific-based numerical analysis. However, *I am of the opinion that* from the software-centric application perspective, Java is the perfect language for just about everything in between (on the server-side/backend). This repo is a work in progress, and if you've come across it feel free to use the code contained within however you please **in accordance with the repositories MIT license**. If you discover a bug, or perhaps you have a more practical and efficient **but tested** implementation, then please submit a pull request.
